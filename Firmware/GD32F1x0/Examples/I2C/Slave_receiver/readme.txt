  This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL-V1.3/GD32190R-EVAL-V1.2 board, it shows the I2C 
programming mode in slave receiving mode. In this demo, BOARD_I2C is operated as slave 
receiver, and the SCL line and SDA line of BOARD_I2C interface are controled by the I/O 
pin PB10 and PB11(or PB6 and PB7) respectively.

  This demo shows the receving process of the slave. And it will store the 
received data in the i2c_receiver array.

  The demo doesn't perform the data transfer actually, which is due to no specific 
master.In the specific application, we need config the master to start a data 
transmission.In addition,the master and the slave may need to be connected by 
the jumper if necessary.
